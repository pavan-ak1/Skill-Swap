# Skill Swap Platform

## Problem Statement
Skill Swap Platform is a mini-application that enables users to list the skills they can offer and request other skills in return. The goal is to make knowledge exchange seamless and community-driven.

### Overview
• Users create a profile with their basic information and optionally upload a photo.
• They add a list of skills they can teach/offer and the skills they wish to learn.
• Availability settings (e.g. weekends, evenings) help coordinate swap sessions.
• Profiles can be set to public or private.
• A search interface lets users browse others by skill keywords such as “Photoshop” or “Excel”.

### Request & Accept Swaps
• Send swap offers to other users and accept or reject incoming offers.
• View current and pending swap requests.
• Withdraw a pending request if it hasn’t been accepted yet.
• Exchange feedback or ratings after a completed swap.

## Key Features

- Skill lists: Offered and Wanted
