# Skill Swap Platform

## Problem Statement
Skill Swap Platform is a mini-application that enables users to list the skills they can offer and request other skills in return. The goal is to make knowledge exchange seamless and community-driven.

### Overview
- Users create a profile with their basic information and optionally upload a photo.
- They add a list of skills they can teach/offer and the skills they wish to learn.
- Availability settings (e.g. weekends, evenings) help coordinate swap sessions.
- Profiles can be set to public or private.
- A search interface lets users browse others by skill keywords such as “Photoshop” or “Excel”.

### Request & Accept Swaps
- Send swap offers to other users and accept or reject incoming offers.
- View current and pending swap requests.
- Withdraw a pending request if it hasn’t been accepted yet.
- Exchange feedback or ratings after a completed swap.

## Key Features
- Public/private user profiles with name, location (optional), and profile photo (optional)
- Skill lists: Offered and Wanted
- Availability scheduling
- Search/browse by skill keyword
- Swap request management (create, accept/reject, cancel)
- Ratings & feedback after swaps
